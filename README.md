# ev-demand-smart-charging

Overview
This project models the impact of increasing EV adoption on peak electricity
demand for a small residential feeder and evaluates demand-side mitigation.

Method
- Half-hourly demand model for 300 households
- Simulated EV uptake scenarios (0–50%)
- Uncontrolled vs delayed charging strategies

Key Results
- Uncontrolled EV charging causes severe evening peak overload
- Peak demand exceeds feeder capacity at ~30% EV penetration
- Delayed charging significantly reduces peak demand

Tools
Python, NumPy, Matplotlib
